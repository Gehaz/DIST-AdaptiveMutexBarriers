- Write-buffer is architecturally after cache, according to our description
one may infer it is before it, not sure if this is problematic in terms
of proofs, but possibly needs to be clarified.

Specifically, we write that "events that are served by the write-buffer are not
considered accesses". Why do we need this? Can we say that this is WLOG?

Re-introduce Theorem 1 (repeat) and its proof.
